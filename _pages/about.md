Currently, I am a second-year PhD student. studying computer science at UC Santa Cruz, advised by [Prof. Chenguang Wang](https://cgraywang.github.io/). 
Previously, I earned a Bachelor of Engineering degree from Xidian University and a Master of Engineering degree in Signal and Information Systems from the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences.
You can find my CV [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SLrocl8O0P6M5c_2K5NZ5FKz0zB6CSQ3/view?usp=sharing).
  
My prior research area: **Sentiment Analysis** and **Information Extraction**. Now, my research interest is in on **LLM post-training** and **agentic AI**.

Works
======
**Software Engineer Internship, Xizhi AI Education.** (2022 - 2024) 
* Scope: Visually Rich Document Information Extraction. 

Xizhi AI Education is a company dedicated to the development of automated problem solving models, famous for develop Eva Tutor App. I was responsible for extracting certain important information from the user's questions to use as input for the solution model. 
After the emergence of LLMs, I was responsible for experiments with prompt and locally deploy of some small LLMs.
