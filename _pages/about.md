I am a second-year PhD student, studying computer science at UC Santa Cruz, advised by [Prof. Chenguang Wang](https://cgraywang.github.io/). 
Previously, I earned a Bachelor of Engineering degree from the TsienHsueshen experimental class at Xidian University and a Master of Engineering degree in Signal and Information Systems from the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences.
My CV is available [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SLrocl8O0P6M5c_2K5NZ5FKz0zB6CSQ3/view?usp=sharing).
  
My research interests include **LLM post-training** and **agentic AI**.

Works
======
**Software Engineer Internship, Xizhi AI Education.** (2022 - 2024) 
* Scope: Visually Rich Document Information Extraction. 

Xizhi AI Education is a company dedicated to the development of automated problem solving models, famous for developing the Eva Tutor App. I was responsible for extracting certain important information from the user's questions to use as input for the solution model. 
After the emergence of LLMs, I was responsible for conducting experiments with prompt design and the local deployment of some small LLMs.
